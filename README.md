## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *Company Home Page With Flexbox*, 
wherein we had to design a home page for a real or imaginary company using **CSS Flexbox**.  I chose to 
design a home page for an imaginary tea shop in St Austell, Cornwall, named *The Lar Tea Shop*.  My solution 
met the following requirements:

- include a title and logo or splash image
- include a mission statement or brief description of the company
- include a set of images representing the company's products
- include a section describing some of the company's employees
- use flexbox styling for layout
- use custom fonts, colors, borders, padding, and images 

***

## Technologies
  
I used **HTML5** and **CSS3** to complete this project.  More specifically, I used **CSS Flexbox** and 
**CSS Media Queries** to ensure that the design of this website is fully responsive and performs well on 
devices of differing screen size.
